# Final Project for Nikki Rosenbloom: 

## 

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) obtained data of ICE detention incident reports from 2012 to 2017. I want to make a [link](https://google.com).

ICE only tracks records of solitary confinement for two reasons:
1. If the detainee is held in isolation for more than 14 days
2. If the detainee has a "special vulnerability" in isolation

Here is some text.

The formula I used was

```
=VLOOKUP("SOMETHING",A2:A100,1,FALSE)
```
