# Final Project for Nikki Rosenbloom: 

## The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) released [data](icij-solitary-voices-final-dataset-for-publication.csv) of nearly 8500 ICE detention incident reports from 2012 to 2017. This data set taught me that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement yields more power than I realized. The scope of its authority allows its officers to isolate detainees for essentially any reason without justification. These reasons are often rooted in racial discrimination and other personal beliefs. 

### As I interrogated and analyzed the data, I noticed certain trends in the detention centers in different states. Overall, I learned about the process of solitary confinement and ICE's eroding objectivity at the forefront of the detention centers.

I obtained this data from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) that was attached in their [article published in 2019](https://www.icij.org/investigations/solitary-voices/about-the-solitary-voices-data/). After I downloaded the CSV file, I imported it into Google Sheets and  used its functions to interrogate and analyze the data.

ICE.

ICE only tracks records of solitary confinement for two reasons:
1. If the detainee is held in isolation for more than 14 days
2. If the detainee has a "special vulnerability" in isolation

Here is some text.

The formula I used was

```
=VLOOKUP("SOMETHING",A2:A100,1,FALSE)
```
